            <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Energy production has always been a
a problem for the world. That’s not because the lack of energy
resources nor the ways of using those resources. The problem is in how to use
those resources efficiently with low energy loss and with low cost. A lot of
ways tried to solve the problem like photovoltaic cells, however it didn’t
harvest the solar energy efficiently as it nearly didn’t exceed 20% of
efficiency also other disadvantages like the high cost and hard building.Thus, Sterling Engine Complex
Compiler (SECC) is made trying to solve that problem. Providing Low cost
materials, it will help addressing the cost problem if used widely. Moreover, the
high theoretical efficiency which is nearly 34% helps harvesting solar energy
better than the solar panels and using it widely in heat concentrated places
will achieve high energy that can operate many homes. Also, using it in mars
exploration by humans will help the astronauts harvest sun energy efficiently
being able to operate their tools and appliances in the space. Our device could achieve the main
three things in energy production which are low cost materials, high net
efficiency and finally, helpful to the environment with no pollution.</p>

            <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2">Stirling engine is a
heat engine that is operated by a cyclic compression and expansion of air or
other gas at different temperatures, resulting in a net conversion
of&nbsp;heat&nbsp;energy to mechanical&nbsp;work. More specifically, the
Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a
permanently&nbsp;gaseous working fluid.&nbsp;<i>Closed-cycle</i>, in this
context, means a&nbsp;thermodynamic system&nbsp;in which the working fluid is
permanently contained within the system.<br>&nbsp;1-The Stirling engine is made of main parts <br> -Power piston and Displacer piston <br> -Gas <br> -Fly-wheel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
              <br>-Fly-wheel
Power piston and displacer piston move according to the
expansion and contraction of gas in the chamber as a result of the continues
change of the temperature of the gas best described by Amontons law which
states that that the pressure of a given mass of gas varies directly with the
absolute temperature of the gas, when the volume is kept constant <!--[if !msEquation]--><!--[if !vml]--><!--[endif]--><!--[endif]-->&nbsp;=k <br> That continues air expansion and contraction is what leads to mechanical work
that the fly-wheel harvest through a rod connected to the power piston and
displacer piston. <br> SECC uses three custom build Stirling engines with modifications for enhanced
efficiency inspired from the original Stirling engine beta design.
Each Stirling engine chamber is independent of the other
except for a small gap between each Stirling engine to stabilize the pressure
between them so that they would all work in sync relatively to each other. 
SECC uses Helium instead of air as a gas due to air having
0.26 W/MK thermal conductivity (at 300 K or 26.6 C) meanwhile Helium has 0.151
W/MK thermal conductivity (at 300 K or 26.6 C).<br> Helium has 580% better conductivity than air; so the temperature will get
transmitted faster; so more expansions and contractions in a minute; so the
power piston and displacer piston would move more; so more mechanical power
output.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-3">Parabolic heater and heat sink</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-4">Parabolic heater
otherwise known as solar collector is a parabolic arc which would be facing
east. This parabolic heater aims to collect as much as possible of sunlight and
focus it in one point using this equation.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <br>&nbsp; this will reflect all the light onto a glassy pipe which
will contain used car oil (synthetic oil) that will
Absorb heat and Transfer it to The Stirling engine Through the pipe’s end which would be made
from iron and would be put in a way that doesn’t make contact with the Stirling
engine but the helium only, saving the SECC from overheating .
&nbsp;this parabolic 
heater covers an area of 2-meter square.
Heat sink is the opposite of parabolic heater; it is
passive&nbsp;heat exchanger&nbsp;that transfers the heat generated by a
mechanical device to a&nbsp;fluid&nbsp;medium, which is atmospheric air, where
it is&nbsp;dissipated&nbsp;away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of
the Helium temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-5">Compiler </h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-6">&nbsp; Compiler’s Main job is to collect the mechanical work from
the three fly-wheel into one 
without a drop in efficacy.
&nbsp;We achieved this by
using a cambelt to connect the three fly-wheels. This was inspired by how a car
engine
&nbsp;works. This cambelt
will spin with a layer of copper wires attached to it nearby magnets that surrounds
the cambelt without touching it. The movement of this magnets will create a
changing magnetic wave which will collide with the copper coil creating a
current according to Lenz’s law.
&nbsp;
Calculating the efficiency of SECC requires knowing each
part final efficiency. Which we concluded after a lot of research.
According to the article named “<b>Modeling and simulation
to determine the thermal efficiency of a parabolic solar trough collector
system” </b>the Parabolic heater has an efficiency of 80%,<b></b> Abuelyamen Research paper. A beta Stirling engine efficiency
is about 7.5% out of the input energy that can be increased up to 15% using
helium as Karabulut research paper states. <br>
          <br> The compiler efficiency on average is around 90% according Richard Wies that
covers this in his reseach paper titled “Energy-Efficient Standalone
Fossil-Fuel Based Hybrid Power Systems Employing Renewable Energy Sources”
According to a Nasa research sun light’s over a meter square
has around 1000 watt of energy produced in an hour, and due to our project’s
parabolic heater covering over 2 meters square that would be an input of 2000
watt per hour.
&nbsp;
With this we can calculate the outcome this the efficiency 
The Parabolic heater will only convert 80% which
equals 1600 watt.<br> In the hour of the SECC the oil would have heated up but won’t have extra heat
stored in. which means that the income would be divided by 3. That’s an income
of 533 watt per chamber.<br>
          <br> a chamber could make 15% of the 533 which is 80 watt per chamber. With 3
chambers that 240 watt.<br> the compiler with convert 90% of the incoming 240 watt which equals 216 watt. <br>
          <br> Once the iron end of the glass pipe and the oil heat up to their maximum
capacity, they would have stored heat, which would result in every chamber
having an income of 1600 watt. That would result in 688 watt per hour. That
could be achieved after an hour and a half approximately.<br>
          <br> the SECC has an efficiency of 12 % in the first hour, but that efficiency
increases up to 34.2% after that by an a hour maximum. <br><!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]-->

        <p class="u-text u-text-1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aiming to provide an easy built
device harvesting solar heat energy efficiently, the SECC (Sterling Engine
Complex Compiler) is built. Built from solar heater, car oil filled pipe,
sterling engine with three pumps contains helium and a compiler, our project
could achieve nearly 34% theoretically which is higher than the solar panels
efficiency with lower cost. It simply works by heating the oil pipe that heats
the sterling engine that moves due to the difference between temperature that’s
because helium and car oil are used. Finally, the mechanical-electrical energy
conversion is achieved by the compiler. It can be used in urban areas for
operating every house for a long time. Also, can be used in Mars supplying
electric energy for robots and other appliances.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-1">In conclusion, Stirling engine is far superior than solar panel; in<br>cost and in efficiency, with efficiency up to 34.2 percent. Especially<br>with the fact that all his martials are easy to access and cheap. This<br>cheap effective solar system can solve a lot of energy crises in third<br>country world with no access to other clean form of energy like<br>hydroelectric generators (which require oceans, rivers) which some<br>countries don’t have or the mechanical energy that come from<br>wind turbines (cause it requires high annual wind speed).<br>Stirling engine still could be more efficient using other fluids like<br>hydrogen and should be further studied along with a better<br>compiler.
